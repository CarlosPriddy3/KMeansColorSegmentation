This was a program I wrote before I had changed majors to Computer Science as part of a research project at Fort Valley State University
The program was one of the very first projects I had ever worked on. As such it is extremely inefficient and clumsily written. GUI was written by my colleage Eddie Priddy.

KMeansColorSegmentation

This program takes pictures and creates color groupings using the K-Means algorithm based on a specified number of K groups
Specificity determines how closely related the pixels in each classification must be.
